# op-framework
The op-framework project has in goal to provide a fully functional FiveM roleplay server (made from scratch) with advanced and highly developed features. The project is also being used to further develop and expand my personal abilities to code and create something others can use and enjoy.

All development is being done by me (Ben / InZidiuZ). No development will be rushed, making sure it is done properly and all the way through. I expect to be pushing further smaller updates for a period, until it is ready to be put on a test server. From there, the features will be tested and tweaked based on user-input received from people that have been invited to take part in development feedback and input (hereafter "**Testers**").

The primary language for the scripts will be lua, due to its ease of use and it being quite lightweight. For nui creation; js, html and css. (I am horrible at working with js, html and css, therefore I am still learning as I go)

*NOTE: There is no warranty or guarantee that this project will ever be finished. Time spent developing this will also be heavily based on how much spare time I got.* 

# bug-reports
During this project's development, there will be numerous instances in which the testers will be playing on a test server. Whenever you (the testers) stumble across broken features or bugs, you are requested to fill in a bug-report using the issues tab on this GitHub. Remember to utilize the template (when it is made) and provide as much information as possible. If there are any features you would like to see changed or enhanced in any way, please post your suggestion on discord so your fellow testers, are able to discuss them with you.

I highly appreciate everyone which finds interest in this project and can contribute in one way or another! <3
