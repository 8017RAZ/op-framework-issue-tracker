# op-framework
The op-framework project has in goal to provide a fully functional FiveM roleplay server (made from scratch) with advanced and highly developed features. The project is also being used to further develop and expand my personal abilities to code and create something others can use and enjoy.

All development is being done by me (Ben / InZidiuZ). No development will be rushed, making sure it is done properly and all the way through. I expect to be pushing further smaller updates for a period, until it is ready to be put on a test server. From there, the features will be tested and tweaked based on user-input received from people that have been invited to take part in development feedback and input, also known as the **testers**.

The primary language for the scripts will be lua, due to its ease of use and it being quite lightweight. For UIs; js, html and css will be used.

*NOTE: There is no warranty or guarantee that this project will ever be finished. Time spent developing this will also be highly dependent on how much spare time I got.* 

I highly appreciate everyone who finds interest in this project and can contribute in one way or another! <3

# bug-reports
During this project's development, there will be numerous instances in which the testers will be playing on a test server. Whenever you (the testers) stumble across broken features or bugs, you are requested to fill in a bug-report using the issues tab on this GitHub. Remember to utilize the template (when it is made) and provide as much information as possible. If there are any features you would like to see changed or enhanced in any way, please post your suggestion on discord so your fellow testers, are able to discuss them with you.

To be done.

# moving forward
From this point on, the goal is to move towards a pre-alpha state, which should give a basic understanding of what approach the server will take. The server will most likely be very unstable and buggy while in this stage. I intend to open for testing when we enter this stage. Currently, I estimate we'll be able to hit pre-alpha early-to-mid February, if I keep on working efficiently on the project. Throughout the pre-alpha stage, my intentions are to do a lot of tweaking, adding rather small mechanics, as well as adding more jobs and other activities which will make for greater variety. From there on, the alpha stage will be entered.
